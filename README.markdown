jsrepl
======

A project I made out of curiosity of its difficulty, this is a basic Javascript [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

The 'gh-pages' branch is a static version of the project, able to be viewed at [http://git.joahg.com/jsrepl/](http://git.joahg.com/jsrepl/)

The 'heroku' branch is the same jsrepl project [running on Heroku](http://jsrepl.git.joahg.com/), where I have enabled saving javascripts.
